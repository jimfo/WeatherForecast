# WeatherForecast
## A Weather App

On my LG-G4 I have a Weather Widget from which I modelled this app. 
This is the first screen or Home Page. The background changes to a darker shade based Sunrise/Sunset of the first
city in the list.

### Issues : 
1. I would like the Loading Indicator to overlay the refresh icon until it's done.
2. I made my own Menu Bar instead of using built-in functionality. I didn't know that functionality existed
   so I'll change that later.

This is the first screen with Five-Day selected.

### Issues :
None. I'm happy with how the Fragment is setup.
